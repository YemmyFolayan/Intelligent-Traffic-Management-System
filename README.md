# FUTA ITMS Mtech Project


### Goal of the project
To design an intelligent traffic management system that uses deep learning for vehicle detection, congestion prediction, and adaptive traffic light control. The project demonstrates my ability to apply CNNs, forecasting models, and distributed decision-making in a real-world AI system.

### About
ITMS is an intelligent traffic management system which uses computer vision and advanced deep learning models to detect vehicles and calculate traffic density at a traffic intersection. It uses a smart custom algorithm that helps control the traffic lights considering the traffic density at each intersection. The system actively learns about the traffic throughout the day and uses deep learning to accurately predict traffic density for any given time of the day.

### Features
* Intelligent Traffic Management using computer vision.
* Google Earth Map.
* An AI Agent to crowdsource and map accident prone areas.
* A smart fine payment module integrated.

### Installation
* Clone the project.
* Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.
* Run `yarn start` to view the project in action.

### OpenCV Demo to Count Vehicles
* In "countingCars" directory, run 'python count.py' .
